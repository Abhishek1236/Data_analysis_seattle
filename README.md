Introduction
Finding an accomodation is the most typical problem to be solved, when travelling to other city or country. And one of the most important things in choosing an accomodation is the reservation price.
#Project Motivation
What are the main factors, which affect the reservation prices? Does time of the year influence prices and what are the busiest times of the year to visit particular city? How can we save money on the reservation?
